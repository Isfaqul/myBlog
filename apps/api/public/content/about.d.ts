export declare const aboutMe = "\nI'm Isfaqul. Self-taught full-stack developer focused on [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/). Learning by building, breaking, and improving every day.\n\nThis blog is a place where I write about what I\u2019m learning, the problems I run into, and the small insights that come from working through them. I care about understanding how things actually work\u2014not just making them work.\n\nLearning hasn\u2019t always been smooth, but I try to stay consistent and improve a little every day. Writing helps me slow down, think clearly, and track that progress over time.\n\nI\u2019m still learning. This is part of that journey.\n";
